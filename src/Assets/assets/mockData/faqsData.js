      "That is a great question! Finding the right trainer isnâ€™t easy and can be a scary prospect.  The last thing you want to do is waste money on the wrong solution and cause any long term problems for your dog, right?\nBecause of this it will be reassuring to you to know that during my time at the Victoria Stilwell Academy, I have had the benefit of training from some of the best people within the industry. Even more encouraging is that the positive reinforcement method I have been trained in is backed heaps of by scientific evidence and is proven to be the best method available to achieve outstanding results.\nTo add to this you can guarantee that your dog will enjoy these sessions and will love to learn!",
